// Package controller contains the main business logic controllers for aqua operations.
// Each subpackage represents a specific aqua command or operation such as install,
// update, exec, which, and updatechecksum. Controllers coordinate between different
// components like configuration, registry, download, and installation to implement
// the core functionality of aqua's declarative CLI version management.
