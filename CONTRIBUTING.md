Only maintainers can create new Issues. If needed, a maintainer will create an Issue after your Discussion been triaged and confirmed.
This way we keep Issues actionable, and free of duplicates or wrong bug reports.

## Feature Request

Please [create a discussion](https://github.com/orgs/aquaproj/discussions/new?category=feature-request) before sending a pull request for Feature Request.

aqua is simple and easy to use.
This is important for aqua.

So we should be careful to add a new feature.
Your feature may be great and valuable, but at the same time that may make aqua complicated and difficult to use.

And maybe there is a better way to solve your problem.

So please create a discussion as proposal at first.
