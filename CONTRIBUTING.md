clivm is simple and easy to use.
This is important for aqua.

So we should be careful to add a new feature.
Your feature may be great and valuable, but at the same time that may make clivm complicated and difficult to use.

And maybe there is a better way to solve your problem.

So please create an issue as proposal at first.
