# Remove supported_if

[#1411](https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua/issues/1411) [#1516](https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua/pull/1516)

Remove `supported_if`.

## Why this change is needed

[supported_envs](/docs/reference/registry-config/supported-envs) is simpler than supported_if, and better in terms of the performance.
