# Cosign and SLSA Provenance

- `aqua >= v1.26.0`
- `aqua-installer >= v2.0.0`

Japanese: [Cosign と SLSA による aqua CLI Version Manager の Security 改善](https://zenn.dev/shunsuke_suzuki/articles/aqua-cosign-slsa)

aqua supports verifying aqua and packages with [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/) and [slsa-verifier](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier).

:::caution
You don't have to install Cosign or slsa-verifier, because aqua installs both automatically.
:::

## Getting Started

First, let's create a container to try this tutorial in clean environment.

```
docker run --rm -ti alpine:3.17.0 sh
```

```
apk add curl bash sudo
adduser -u 1000 -G wheel -D foo
visudo # Uncomment "%wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL"
su foo
mkdir ~/workspace
cd ~/workspace
export PATH="${AQUA_ROOT_DIR:-${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/aquaproj-aqua}/bin:$PATH"
```

## Verify aqua-installer with checksum

You can install aqua by the following one liner.

```sh
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquaproj/aqua-installer/v4.0.2/aqua-installer | bash
```

But the one liner is a bit dangerous because aqua-installer may be tampered.

You can verify aqua-installer with checksum.

```sh
curl -sSfL -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquaproj/aqua-installer/v4.0.2/aqua-installer
echo "98b883756cdd0a6807a8c7623404bfc3bc169275ad9064dc23a6e24ad398f43d  aqua-installer" | sha256sum -c -
chmod +x aqua-installer
```

You have to update the checksum everytime aqua-installer is updated, but aqua-installer isn't updated so frequently.

## Verify aqua

Let's install aqua with aqua-installer. aqua-installer verifies aqua with slsa-verifier.

```sh
./aqua-installer
```

Please see the log. You can confirm aqua is verified with slsa-verifier.

```
INFO[0001] verify a package with slsa-verifier           aqua_version=1.26.2 env=linux/arm64 new_version=v1.26.2 package_name=aquaproj/aqua package_version=v1.26.2 program=aqua registry=

```

If aqua is tampered the installation would fail.

## Verify packages

aqua supports verifying packages with Cosign and slsa-verifier, but it requires the following things.

1. A tool publishes signature or SLSA Provenance
1. A package has settings for Cosign or SLSA Provenance

At the moment, there are very few tools publishing signature or SLSA Provenance, but we hope many tools publishes them in future.

### Verify packages with Cosign

For example, [tflint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint) publishes signature in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/releases).

And standard registry has a setting of cosign for tflint.

[registry.yaml](https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua-registry/blob/726e274fade1a6fc71cde029f858893131b38078/pkgs/terraform-linters/tflint/registry.yaml#L11-L25)

```yaml
    checksum:
      type: github_release
      asset: checksums.txt
      file_format: regexp
      algorithm: sha256
      pattern:
        checksum: ^(\b[A-Fa-f0-9]{64}\b)
        file: "^\\b[A-Fa-f0-9]{64}\\b\\s+(\\S+)$"
      cosign:
        cosign_experimental: true
        opts:
          - --signature
          - https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/releases/download/{{.Version}}/checksums.txt.keyless.sig
          - --certificate
          - https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/releases/download/{{.Version}}/checksums.txt.pem
```

Let's install tflint. To verify checksum's signature, you have to enable [Checksum Verification](/docs/guides/checksum).

```sh
aqua init
vi aqua.yaml # Enable checksum verification
aqua g -i terraform-linters/tflint
aqua i
```

Please see the log. You can confirm Cosign is installed automatically.

```
INFO[0000] download and unarchive the package            aqua_version=1.26.2 env=linux/arm64 package_name=sigstore/cosign package_version=v1.13.1 program=aqua registry=

```

And tflint is verified with Cosign.

```

Verified OK
```

### Verify packages with slsa-verifier

[aquaproj/example-go-slsa-provenance](https://github.com/aquaproj/example-go-slsa-provenance) publishes SLSA Provenance,
so let's install it.

```sh
aqua g -i aquaproj/example-go-slsa-provenance
aqua i
```

Please see the log. You can confirm the package is verified with slsa-verifier.

```
INFO[0000] verify a package with slsa-verifier           aqua_version=1.26.2 env=linux/arm64 package_name=aquaproj/example-go-slsa-provenance package_version=v0.1.2 program=aqua registry=standard

```

If the package is tampered, the installation would fail.
Let's try to install example-go-slsa-provenance v0.1.1, which was tamperred intentionally for the demonstration.

```
vi aqua.yaml # Change the version to v0.1.1
aqua i
```

Then the installation would fail expectedly.

```

## Disable the verification with Cosign and SLSA Provenance

aqua >= [v2.22.0](https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua/releases/tag/v2.22.0) [#2631](https://github.com/orgs/aquaproj/discussions/2631) [#2633](https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua/pull/2633) [#2634](https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua/pull/2634)

:::caution
This feature is for users who can't use Cosign and slsa-verifier.
Most users can use them so don't need this feature.
aqua installs Cosign and slsa-verifier internally, so you don't need to install them yourself.
If you can use Cosign and slsa-verifier, you should not disable them because they are important for security.
:::

You can disable the verification with Cosign and SLSA Provenance.

### Why is the feature needed?

Cosign and sla-verifier access some endpoints such as `oauth2.sigstore.dev` and `fulcio.sigstore.dev`.
So to use them you need to allow the access to these endpoints.

But in some use cases you can't or don't want to do that.
For example, your company's network policy might not allow the access to these endpoints.

To resolve the issue, this issue proposes to support disabling the verification with Cosign and slsa-verifier.

### How to disable Cosign and SLSA

You can use command line options `-disable-cosign` and `-disable-slsa` or environment variables `AQUA_DISABLE_COSIGN` and `AQUA_DISABLE_SLSA`.

e.g.

```sh
aqua [-disable-cosign] [-disable-slsa] i
```

```sh
env AQUA_DISABLE_COSIGN=true AQUA_DISABLE_SLSA=true aqua i
```

### Disable Cosign and SLSA (aqua-installer)

[aqua-installer >= v2.3.0](https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua-installer/releases/tag/v2.3.0)

To disable the verification when you install aqua with aqua-installer, please use aqua-installer v2.3.0 or newer and set the environment variables `AQUA_DISABLE_COSIGN` and `AQUA_DISABLE_SLSA`.

```sh
export AQUA_DISABLE_COSIGN=true
export AQUA_DISABLE_SLSA=true
./aqua-installer
```

```yaml
- uses: aquaproj/aqua-installer@d1fe50798dbadd4eb5b98957290ca175f6b4870f # v4.0.2
  with:
    aqua_version: v2.48.3
  env:
    AQUA_DISABLE_COSIGN: "true"
    AQUA_DISABLE_SLSA: "true"
```
