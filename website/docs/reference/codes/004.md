# command is not found

You may face the error `command is not found` when you run a command.

e.g.

```console
$ ci-info --version
FATA[0000] aqua failed                                   aqua_version= env=linux/arm64 error="command is not found" exe_name=ci-info program=aqua
```

## What does this error mean?

This error means the command isn't found in your configuration files.
aqua searches [configuration files](/docs/reference/config#configuration-file-path) and searches the command from configuration files.
The error occurs when aqua can't find the command.

## How to solve the error

1. If you want to install the command by aqua, please create `aqua.yaml` and add the package to `aqua.yaml`.

e.g.

```sh
aqua init
aqua g -i suzuki-shunsuke/ci-info
```

2. If you want to install the package globally, please see [Install tools globally](/docs/tutorial/global-config).

3. If you want to install the command without aqua, please install the command as you like.

e.g.

```sh
homebrew suzuki-shunsuke/ci-info/ci-info
```

You don't have to remove the symbolic link in `$AQUA_ROOT_DIR/bin`.
