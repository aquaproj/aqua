# the executable file isn't installed yet. Lazy Install is disabled

You may face the error when you execute a command managed by aqua.

e.g.

```console
$ tfcmt -v
FATA[0000] aqua failed                                   aqua_version= doc="https://aquaproj.github.io/docs/reference/codes/006" env=darwin/arm64 error="the executable file isn't installed yet. Lazy Install is disabled" exe_name=tfcmt package=suzuki-shunsuke/tfcmt package_version=v1.0.0 program=aqua
```

## What does this error mean?

This error occurs when Lazy Install is disabled and the executed command isn't installed yet.

Please see [Disable Lazy Install](/docs/reference/lazy-install#disable-lazy-install) too.

## How to solve the error

Install packages by `aqua i` without `-l` option before executing commands.

```console
$ aqua i
```

GitHub Actions [aquaproj/aqua-installer](https://aquaproj.github.io/docs/products/aqua-installer/#github-actions) uses `-l` option by default, so please disable `-l` option with the input `aqua_opts`.

e.g.

```yaml
- uses: aquaproj/aqua-installer@d1fe50798dbadd4eb5b98957290ca175f6b4870f # v4.0.2
  with:
    aqua_version: v2.48.3
    aqua_opts: ""
```

Or if you'd like to enable Lazy Install, please remove the environment variable `AQUA_DISABLE_LAZY_INSTALL`.
