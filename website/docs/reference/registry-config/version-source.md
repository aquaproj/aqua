# version_source

[#811](https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua/pull/811) aqua >= [v1.8.0](https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua/releases/tag/v1.8.0)

By default, `aqua g` gets the latest version from GitHub Releases.
By setting `version_source: github_tag`, aqua gets from GitHub Repository Tag instead of GitHub Releases.
This is useful for tools without GitHub Releases.
