# Install private packages

Of course, [Standard Registry](https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua-registry) doesn't include private packages, which are hosted in private GitHub Repositories.
But you can install private packages by creating your own `local` Registry or `github_content` Registry.

About how to create a Registry, please see [Develop a Registry](/docs/develop-registry/).
